This program (decision_tree_2.py) reads in 3 different training datasets (contact_lens_training_1.csv, contact_lens_training_2.csv, and contact_lens_training_3.csv) and 1 test dataset (contact_lens_test.csv) to train and test a decision tree model. The program then calculates the average accuracy of the model over 10 runs.
